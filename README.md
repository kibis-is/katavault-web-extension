## üî≠ 1. Overview

### 1.1. Terminology

* **Client**: These are all external resources to the worker, except the middleware. These include webpages and other extensions.
* **Middleware**: Also known as content scripts. These resources automatically injected into the webpage and have limited access to both the web extension APIs and the webpage's DOM.
* **Worker**: This is the web extension and includes both the extension's service workers and pages/pop-ups. These have full access to the web extension APIs and communicate to clients via the middleware.

## üõ† 2. Development

### 2.1. Requirements

* Install [Node v20.18.0+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install [pnpm v10.3.0+](https://pnpm.io/installation)
* Install [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) (optional ‚Äî required if you are installing the local Chrome browser)

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

### 2.2. Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
```bash
$ pnpm install
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** a post install script will run that creates a `.env` file.

2. In the newly created `.env` file, replace the environment values with the desired values.

### 2.3. Install local browsers (optional)

To run a standalone browser for development, local developer versions of Chrome and/or Firefox can be installed. If these are installed, these will be used as the installation of the temporary extensions that are built in step [2.4.](#24-run)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** The following commands can be run again to re-download and install the latest version. Your saved profile and extension settings will not be affected as they are stored in a separate directory in `.<chrome|firefox>_profile/`.

#### 2.3.1. Chrome

1. Simply run:
```shell
pnpm install:chrome
```

> Ô∏è **NOTE:** the binary will be installed to `.chrome/`.

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

#### 2.3.2. Firefox

1. Simply run:
```shell
pnpm install:firefox
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** the binary will be installed to `.firefox/`.

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

### 2.4. Run

* To run simply use:
```bash
$ pnpm dev:<chrome|firefox>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** This command will bundle the TypeScript source code and extension assets into the `.<chrome|firefox>_build/` directory and, depending on your intended target (you can choose '`chrome`' or '`firefox`') the corresponding browser will start up with the unpacked extension as a temporary extension.
